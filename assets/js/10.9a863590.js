Other distros (like Arch) would do that manually anyway, just follow the standard procedure from the beginner guide (without formatting the EFI, because it's already formatted to FAT32) and follow through. Personally, I would recommend not to install other bootloaders (like systemd-boot or grub) for the likes of arch because OpenCore can boot linux kernels that have EFISTUB support, if you do however like using a separate bootloader, you can have it your way, it doesn't change anything.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=i.exports}}]);
